# Jets Project

Developed as a weekend solo project for Skill Distillery SD32

### Description
This Java 1.8 project provides the ability to operate several options on an airfield of jets.  Three subclasses, or types, of jets exist: Cargo Plane, Fighter Jet, and Normal.  Using the console, the program imports and parses through an initial data set (CSV) stored in an external .txt file.  A user can explore options for this existing data set, add/remove elements from the initial set, and save to additional files.  Data created is simply a random set and does not reflect any real-life data.

### Lessons Learned
- Polymorphism knows no bounds and could be expanded to concepts far reaching.
- It is difficult to avoid having too much of your code in one method unless you slow down and plan for such ahead of time.

### Technologies Used
- Java
- Eclipse
- Atom
- Github
- Terminal
- MacBook Pro Retina 2015

### What was fun? Areas for future improvement?
- This was my first project using interfaces and abstract methods.  I look forward to exploring more uses and techniques.
- This project was developed quickly and as such, feels a bit disorganized.  I would enjoy working on the same concept through multiple drafts and to study existing, professional-grade code to see how to properly organize things.
- I could have used a TreeSet or TreeMap to better organize the pilots.  I look forward to exploring additional data types, structures, and techniques to better organize and strategize larger and larger applications.
